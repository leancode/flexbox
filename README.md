# flexbox
Fork of https://github.com/VitaliyMF/flexbox
which is fork of original jQuery FlexBox (v0.9.6) with some fixes + enhancements

FlexBox is a jQuery plugin that is intended to be a very flexible replacement for html
textboxes and dropdowns, optionally using ajax to retrieve and bind JSON data.

It can be used as a:

ComboBox, with optional per-result html templates
Suggest box, like Google’s search
Data-driven type-ahead input box
It supports:

Auto-completion using local (JSON) or remote (JSON via ajax) data
Skinning via css
Flexible paging of results
Configurable client-side caching
Much more… (see Configuration Options)
